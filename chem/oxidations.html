	<h2>what are oxidation states?</h2>
	<p>For anyone studying chemistry, we'll often come across notations like Na⁺ or O²⁻. Obviously, the first one represents a sodium ion, while the other represents an oxide ion.</p>
	<p>But of course, many elements, especially non-metals, don't have a uniformly defined "charge" or "state of existence", and for covalent bonding ions are practically out of the question (except for compound ions). Hence, for simplicity and ease of demonstration, scientists have used oxidation states to refer to this state of how much "charge" it carries.</p>
	<p>This is defined as the <b>hypothetical charge of an atom as if it were fully ionic in a compound</b>.</p>
	<p>For mostly ionic compounds, this is easy to derive; for mostly covalent compounds, the electronegativity spectrum of the elements matters, as elements which are more electronegative tend to "suck up" more electrons (or rather, the negative charge) shared in the bonds. Hence, an more electronegative element will be assigned a negative charge, and vice versa.</p>
	<br />
	<h2>the rules of assigning oxidation states (OS)</h2>
	<p>Generally speaking, there's 2 simple rules:</p>
	<p>1. Hydrogen has an OS of +1.</p>
	<p>2. Oxygen has an OS of -2.</p>
	<p>There are, however, tons of exceptions. Therefore, people have constructed various sets of rules with a specific order of priority. The general rule goes as follows:</p>
	<p>1. An element in free variation has OS = 0.</p>
	<p>2. The sum of the OS of all elements is equal to the overall charge of compound or ion.</p>
	<p>3. Fluorine in a compound always has OS = -1, since it is the most electronegative. Similarly, Cl and Br have OS = -1 when not bound to a lighter halogen, O or N.</p>
	<p>4. Group 1 and 2 metals have OS = +1 and OS = +2 respectively (metals generally form ions in a compound anyway, so their OS follows the charge.)</p>
	<p>5. Hydrogen has an OS of +1, except when bound to metals, where its OS = -1.</p>
	<p>6. Oxygen generally has OS = -2 when not bound to oxygen or fluorine.</p>
	<p>These 6 rules are usually sufficient to cover many commonly seen compounds.</p>
	<br />
	<h2>the less weird examples</h2>
	<p>However, even with the above examples, sometimes it takes quite a bit of effort to figure out the oxidation states of elements in a given compound.</p>
	<p>It's thus helpful to write down the structure in Lewis form (with all the bonds drawn), since it's way easier to figure out what goes where.</p>
	<p>Let's take HOONO (peroxynitrous acid) as an example. First off, we can immediately take H = +1, and the rightmost O = -2 since O is more electronegative than N.</p>
	<p>The tricky part comes in the middle O-O bond, a homonuclear bond (bond involving 2 of the same element). Usually when we encounter this, it is treated as -2 together, as if it were an peroxide anion.</p>
	<p>Hence, each of the Os in that bond has OS = -1. Following the OS sum rule, we get N = +3. In fact, N can assume a variety of oxidation states even though we would usually say "N takes 3 electrons to become nitride", such as +5 in nitric acid.</p>
	<p>This effect is more demonstrated in organic compounds (which involve carbon), as the rules cause carbon to have a variety of OSes, ranging from -4 to +4.</p>
	<p>For metal complexes, the central metal is usually said to have an OS = 0, while electronegativity is calculated on each of the ligands separately.</p>
	<br />
	<h2>the more weird examples</h2>
	<p>Well, that's the easier part. Now let's take this a step further and explore some of the weirder oxidation states that we wouldn't expect to appear.</p>
	<h3><u>1. Metals</u></h3>
	<p>We generally regard metals to have a positive OS (or a positive charge, since cations and stuff). But even metals can be "rebellious" and assume negative oxidation states, especially when we consider transition metals (those in groups 3 through 10), as well as a bit of 11 to 13.</p>
	<p>Wikipedia lists a good example of this: perovskite, which has a formation of AuRb₃O. (Rb is rubidium, a group 1 element.)</p>
	<p>Since O = -2, this leads to Au (gold) having an OS of -1 (i.e. auride), which is of course unusual.</p>
	<h3><u>2. Fractional states</u></h3>
	<p>For some compounds, there can be multiple of one element. Sometimes we want to find how much an element has been reduced or oxidized, or in other words, how much its OS has changed.</p>
	<p>In such cases, the average OS of an element is considered. For example, in magnetite (Fe₃O₄, in practice FeO + 2(Fe₂O₃)), the average OS of iron is 8/3 since the 4 oxides take up -8 total, leaving +8 for the 3 irons.</p>
	<p>A non-metal example is the cyclopentadienyl anion C₅H₅⁻. Here, each H takes up +1, so the 5 carbons together take up an OS of -6. This results in each C having an OS = -6/5.</p>
	<p>But if we are talking about weird oxidation states, of course we have to talk about the even more chaotic examples, some of which are practically only synthesized in labs.</p>
	<h3><u>3. The chaotic</u></h3>
	<p>Ever heard of a "sodide" (or "natride") ion? Yeah it's Na⁻, not Na⁺. This can be seen in "inverse NaH"; normally we would expect [Na⁺][H⁻], but inverse NaH is prepared using a form of adamanzane (a ligand, basically), where H⁺ is shielded from the Na⁻.</p>
	<p>Another example is the dioxygenyl cation, O₂⁺, where each O has a OS of +1/2. This is prepared, and first discovered, by reacting O₂ with PtF₆. Interestingly, the discovery of this cation also led to the discovery of xenon compounds (previously thought impossible, since Xe is a noble gas, hence very stable against forming compounds), where Xe assumes a positive OS. </p>
	<p>Of course, these are real phenomenons; there's way more cursed chemistry out there waiting for both you and me to discover.</p>
