	<h2>introduction</h2>
	<p>Traditionally, we are usually only taught the more important metals, such as alkali or alkaline, or those in the first 20 to 30, or something more important like gold.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, this leaves other metals out of the curriculum. But, in my opinion, they are a fascinating world to discover, and you may not even realize just how much of those we're using in daily life.</p>
	<p>For example, we don't see a lot of transition metals, which are defined as metals in the groups 3 through 10. Or the lanthanides and actinides either, which are those in the bottom 2 rows separated from the main chart in your periodic table. Or a bunch of metals in groups 11 to 13.</p>
	<p>Hence, as a token of appreciation to these often forgotten metals, let's talk about them here.</p>
	<p>For the sake of ordering, we'll go through the more commonly heard metals first, then the ones you'll sometimes hear about, and finally the rarer (literally) ones.</p>
	<br />
	<h2>the more commonly heard metals</h2>
	<p>I'll include all of the period 4 transition metals, silver, cadmium, gold, tungsten, platinum, tin, mercury, lead, uranium and thorium here.</p>
	<h3><u>1. The 7 metals of antiquity</u></h3>
	<p>These are iron, gold, tin, copper, lead, mercury, and silver. It is called "antiquity" because those are all found a very long time ago before we found the rest.</p>
	<p>We also know that iron (and copper, in the form of vitamin B12) is essential to humans (in fact, you can't even live without iron, because you won't have red blood cells.)</p>
	<p>Mercury and lead are known to be quite poisonous, even though they are quite useful in things such as thermometers and car batteries.</p>
	<p>Gold and silver are often known as "noble metals", not only because they are used by powerful and rich people (and still is today), but also because they are quite low on the metal reactivity scale.</p>
	<p>However, they can react under specific conditions, such as with all the silver halide compounds, and aqua regia (a mixture of HCl and HNO₃) can dissolve gold.</p>
	<p>Tin is less heard often, and should not be confused with the term "tin foil" with its modern day meaning. Originally, foil <i>was</i> made of tin, until it got superseded by aluminium foil, except we still use the term "tin foil" to refer to it.</p>
	<h3><u>2. The other period 4 metals</u></h3>
	<p>Scandium: Due to it being element 21, it shares similarities with group 13 metals (e.g. Al), such as the +3 oxidation state being the most common. It is primarily used in aluminium alloys, and surprisingly, as a light source material.</p>
	<p>Titanium: this metal is more famous for its insane resistance, even to some of the strongest acids, as well as its very high strength-to-density ratio, which makes its alloys very good for making platings. Additionally, TiO₂ is used as a pigment as well as in sunscreen as it reflects and absorbs UV light.</p>
	<p>Vanadium: Vanadium is very interesting in that it is (practically) the first metal (if we count ascending in element number) to have multiple oxidation states that are relatively stable, those being +2, +3, +4 and +5, all with different colors in aqueous form. As a result, it is a very good example to use in demonstrating redox reactions. As for real world usage, it is used as a steel additive and as catalysts (due to that oxidation property)</p>
	<p>Chromium: Similar to vanadium, chromium also exhibits many colors (chrome, hence chromium), such as blue (+2), green (+3), orange or yellow (+6). Those "stainless steel" tools you see in kitchenware <i>is</i> in fact coated with a layer of chromium, due to its high resistance to corrosion.</p>
	<p>Manganese: Yet another color with a wide range of oxidation states and respective colors, going up as high as +7. It is esepcially important in steel making, and you may have also learnt that MnO₂ catalyses the natural breakdown of H₂O₂ into H₂O and O₂ (apart from catalase).</p>
	<p>Cobalt: You may have seen blue glass. There's a pretty good chance it's doped with a cobalt compound, which gives off the distinctive blue color. Additionally, Co-60 is quite an important radioisotope, used in gamma rays.</p>
	<p>Nickel: Well, nickels are partially made of nickel. It is one of my favourite elements just because it does this bluish-green aqueous thing, which looks very calm and cool. Apart from that, it is also used in stainless steel (again!), as well as an ingredient in constantan (thanks Create mod for letting me learn this).</p>	
	<p>Zinc: Honestly, this should just go on the first part just because it was also found very long ago. Zinc is used in a variety of purposes, the most important of these being galvanizing and brass and bronze.</p>
	<p>A side note: iron and copper can also exhibit colored ions: Fe²⁺, Fe³⁺, Fe⁶⁺ (in the form of ferrate(VI), which is FeO₄²⁻); and Cu⁺, Cu²⁺, also notably CuCl₄²⁻, and the less common Cu³⁺.</p>
	<p>And of course, depending on the solution, these metal ions can exhibit even more colors, which is just fascinating.</p>
	<h3><u>Everything else in that list</u></h3>
	<p>Cadmium: Batteries, my friend; as well as CdS, which is very yellow, and was used as a pigment during early days until we found out that it's quite toxic.</p>
	<p>Tungsten: Light bulbs. Or at least until we found more efficient ways of using them. But anyhow, it is very dense as well as a metal. By the way, the symbol W comes from wolfram, which in turn comes from wolframite, the ore which it is extracted from. Nowadays it is used primarily in tungsten carbide, which is very hard.</p>
	<p>Thorium: The lesser known "nuclear metal", though still worth a mention because you may have encountered one of those "nuclear decay chains" when you're learning Physics. It can also be turned into fissile uranium.</p>
	<p>Uranium: Also known as the "haha funny nuclear metal". Nuclear reactors and bombs use this metal, but what you may not know is that it is also used in radioactive glass (giving off a green "fluorescent" color) and high-density penetrators.</p>
	<p>Platinum: Sometimes platinum is placed above gold in gaming awards, and for good reason: it is much rarer than gold. Additionally, it is also very resistant, and it has use in electronics, caalysts, and even medicine (in the form of cisplatin, used in chemotherapy).</p>
	<br />
	<h2>the less commonly heard metals</h2>
	<p>Bismuth: We start with this because it has particular use in Pepto-Bismol, which is a medication used to treat acid stomachaches, and is, in fact, one of the standard treatments in peptic ulcer. Additionally, its crystals are rainbow-colored, and can be very pretty.</p>
	<p>Americium: Wait a second, what's an actinide doing here? Smoke detectors, of course. Its emission of alpha particles (and subsequent decay into neptunium, more on this below) is useful in helping to detect smoke, since smoke will block alpha particles, and trigger the alarm.</p>
	<p>Gallium: the lesser-known liquid metal (it melts just above room temperature, and it can melt in your hands), making it quite fun to mess with. Interestingly it also "rots" away aluminium stuff.</p>
	<p>Arsenic: some classify this as a metal, some don't. The main reason why we don't hear it as much as because it's quite toxic. Except we do have ATO (arsenic trioxide), which is used as an agent against acute promyelocytic leukemia (a pretty nasty blood cancer).</p>
	<p>Antimony: Yet another metal discovered in ancient times but wasn't included in the 7 metals list. Apart from the Chinese making "sha bi" (idiot) jokes out of this element's chemical name, Sb (for stibium) (and ironically China is the largest producer), you may have also heard of HSbF6, which is one of, if not the, strongest acids to exist.</p>
	<p>Neptunium and plutonium: more "funny nuclear metals", amirite. And yes, in case you are wondering these are discovered because of nuclear bombs, and the demon core thing is real and can kill you.</p>
	<p>Technicium: the first element down the periodic table with no stable isotopes. It's primary purpose is in medical imaging, in the form of Tc-99m, and Tc-99 actually has quite a long half life.</p>
	<p>The rest of the noble metals: ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, rhenium, osmium, iridium. All of these are, like silver and gold, very resistant to simple acids, and are very rare. Special mention goes to osmium, which is the densest element out of all, and OsO₄ is notoriously toxic.</p>
	<p>Radium: a radioactive metal, though you may have heard of it because of radium watches, which were used in the past as a form of glowing watches. Though of course now it isn't used anymore because it decays into radon (a radioactive gas), and eventually into toxic lead.</p>
	<p>Germanium: the "lesser brother" of silicon. Though this is quite an unfair description of it, since it does have use in optics and electronics, especially as semiconductors (with silicon).</p>
	<p>Yttrium: if anyone's watched NileRed, then you may know this: YBCO. Yes, yttrium is one of the components.</p>
	<p>Neodymium and praseodymium: Just, magnets. And glassware too; it was actually first found as "didymium", and it is an alloy of the two.</p>
	<p>Indium: aka the "metal which you can make a bite on". Perhaps the most important use of it is in the discovery of blue LEDs (thank you Veritasium), which allowed the whole-color display we have today. Europium deserves mention here too, as it is the most important element for the red phosphor. </p>
	<p>Niobium (and tantalum): You may have heard of these in space engineering and stuff, and indeed, Nb-based alloys are used in spacecraft. Tantalum, on the other hand, is quite notorious for being the "conflict resource", aka countries fight over it, resulting in tons of human suffering.</p>
	<p>Molybdenum: you can thank the Greeks for making this element have a "bd" consonant cluster. Jokes aside, it has use in metallurgy, and surprisingly it is actually a essential element, as some enzymes do use Mo as a catalyst.</p>
	<p>Thallium: another toxic metal, and its salts are especially toxic. It is historically used as rat poison, and as a not-so-fun fact, is still used as a poison today.</p>
	<br />
	<h2>the truly unseen metals</h2>
	<p>The rest of the lanthanides: Most of these are pretty similar in characteristics, except promethium, which doesn't have a stable isotope and is very radioactive. It being rare-earth metals means that it's actually quite useful in lots of things.</p>
	<p>Everything else in the 80s to the 100s range (atomic number-wise) Again, these are all very similar in form, in the way that they are very radioactive and we can't really utilize them in daily life. Outside of that though, they can help synthesize even heavier elements in labs, so we may potentially have stuff like element 119 in the future. </p>
	<p>Nevertheless, each of these metals are very interesting, and it's definitely worth checking them out.</p>
