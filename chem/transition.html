	<h2>introduction</h2>
	<p>Traditionally, we are usually only taught the more important metals, such as alkali or alkaline, or those in the first 20 to 30, or something more important like gold.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, this leaves other metals in the dust, and they are usually left out in the curriculum. But, in my opinion, they are a fascinating world to discover, and you may not even realize just how much of those we're using in daily life.</p>
	<p>This includes transition metals, which are defined as metals in the groups 3 through 10, as well as a number of metals in groups 11 to 13, plus the lanthanides and actinides, which are those in the bottom 2 rows separated from the main chart in your periodic table.</p>
	<p>Hence, as a token of appreciation to these often forgotten metals, let's talk about them here.</p>
	<p>For the sake of ordering, we'll go through the more commonly heard metals first, then the ones you'll sometimes hear about, and finally the rarer (literally) ones.</p>
	<br />
	<h2>the more commonly heard metals</h2>
	<p>I'll include the entire section of period 4 transition metals, silver, cadmium, gold, tungsten, platinum, tin, mercury, lead, uranium and thorium here.</p>
	<h2>the less commonly heard metals</h2>
	<h2>the truly unseen metals</h2>
