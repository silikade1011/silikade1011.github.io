	<h2>What is Cooked English?</h2>
	<p><i>Cooked English (CE; *Cóked Énglisç in CE)</i> is a system I designed as a fun little project/challenge to fix English spelling.</p>
	<h3>Goals:</h3>
	<p>1. Make English spelling more consistent</p>
	<p>2. Trace back etymology when we need it</p>
	<p>3. Make English follow more of the alphabetic principle (though with the above restrictions, CE can't be fully phonemic; there are, however, sets of rules to dictate pronunciation)</p>
	<br />
	<h2>What are the letters?</h2>
	<p>All of the 26 letters of the alphabet (from A to Z) will be used, with a few changes:</p>
	<h3>1. New letters</h3>
	<p>Þ: thorn (þorn). This letter originated from a rune of the same name, and was used in Old English (alongside Ð, eth) to spell the sounds we now spell as "th": the voiceless and voiced dental fricatives.</p>
	<p>Ç: çe (che). This letter originated as a Visigothic Z, and is used in e.g. French to denote a /s/ before back vowels, and e.g. Turkish to denote /tʃ/. This letter will be used in the same way as in Turkish to write "ch".</p>
	<p>Ᵹ: ᵹe (je). This letter originated as a variant of writing the letter "g" (also known as insular g). Here it is used to write the /dʒ/ sound, commonly represented by "g", "dg", and "j".</p>
	<p>Ȝ: joȝ (yogh). This letter started off as the above one, but simplified in writing. Here it represents a remnant of the old "gh" that has gone silent (in fact, this letter is also used to write that sound in Middle English), and to transcribe the "ch" in Scottish "loch".</p>
	<p>Æ: asç (ash). Obviously, this letter is an "A" and an "E" smashed together. This letter will be used like how it is used in Danish and Norwegian, to denote the /ɛ/ sound when it is written "ea".</p>
	<p>Ø: øþel (erthel). Now I know that this letter commonly represents /ø/ in the languages that use it, but it is similar enough to English /ɝ/ that I will use it to write "or" when it is pronounced that way. Additionally (though optional) I will also denote o = /ʌ/ this way.</p>
	<p>Optionally:</p>
	<p>Ŋ can be used as an abbreviation for "ng".</p>
	<p>Ð can be used as an alternative to Þ.</p>
	<h3>2. Changes in the use of the original English alphabet</h3>
	<p>J will solely be used for /j/, with no exceptions.</p>
	<p>G will solely be used for /g/; there's no such thing as a soft "g" anymore.</p>
	<p>Hard and soft C will be kept; though made a tiny bit more consistent.</p>
