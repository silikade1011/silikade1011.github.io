	<h2>What is Cooked English?</h2>
	<p><i>Cooked English (CE; *Cóked Énglisç in CE)</i> is a system I designed as a fun little project/challenge to fix English spelling.</p>
	<h3>Goals:</h3>
	<p>1. Make English spelling more consistent</p>
	<p>2. Trace back etymology when we need it</p>
	<p>3. Make English follow more of the alphabetic principle (though with the above restrictions, CE can't be fully phonemic; there are, however, sets of rules to dictate pronunciation)</p>
	<br />
	<h2>The writing system</h2>
	<h3><b><u>1. New letters</u></b></h3>
	<p>Þ: thorn (þorn). This letter originated from a rune of the same name, and was used in Old English (alongside Ð, eth) to spell the sounds we now spell as "th": the voiceless and voiced dental fricatives.</p>
	<p>Ç: çe (che). This letter originated as a Visigothic Z, and is used in e.g. French to denote a /s/ before back vowels, and e.g. Turkish to denote /tʃ/. This letter will be used in the same way as in Turkish to write "ch".</p>
	<p>Ᵹ: ᵹe (je). This letter originated as a variant of writing the letter "g" (also known as insular g). Here it is used to write the /dʒ/ sound, commonly represented by "g", "dg", and "j".</p>
	<p>Ȝ: joȝ (yogh). This letter started off as the above one, but simplified in writing. Here it represents a remnant of the old "gh" that has gone silent (in fact, this letter is also used to write that sound in Middle English), and to transcribe the "ch" in Scottish "loch".</p>
	<p>Æ: asç (ash). Obviously, this letter is an "A" and an "E" smashed together. This letter will be used like how it is used in Danish and Norwegian, to denote the /ɛ/ sound when it is written "ea".</p>
	<p>Ø: øþel (erthel). Now I know that this letter commonly represents /ø/ in the languages that use it, but it is similar enough to English /ɝ/ that I will use it to write "or" when it is pronounced that way. Additionally (though optional) I will also denote o = /ʌ/ this way.</p>
	<p>For Ȝ and Ᵹ, they are interchangeable with G under some words, e.g. síȝn (sign) but signature.</p>
	<p>Optionally:</p>
	<p>Ŋ can be used as an abbreviation for "ng".</p>
	<p>Ð can be used as an alternative to Þ.</p>
	<br />
	<h3><b><u>2. Consonant use changes</u></b></h3>
	<p>J will solely be used for /j/, with no exceptions.</p>
	<p>G will solely be used for /g/; there's no such thing as a soft "g" anymore.</p>
	<p>Hard and soft C will be kept; though made a tiny bit more consistent.</p>
	<br />
	<h3><b><u>3. The vowel system</u></b></h3>
	<p><b>a. The schwa</b></p>
	<p>How do we write the schwa? My solution is: just leave it there, mostly.</p>
	<p>the letter Ø comes into play as notation for a reduced "o", leaving mostly A and E as schwas instead.</p>

	<p>ai representing /ɛ/ is spelt æ.</p>

	<p>ocean is spelt "ôsçêan" to better match with "ôsçéanic" (oceanic).</p>

	<h3><u>Opening text of a translated version of De Bello Gallico by Julius Caesar</u></h3>
	<p>Âll Gâl is divided intó þré parts, óan of whiç þe Belgae inhabit, þe Aquitani anøþer, þose whó in þeir ôn languaȝe ar called Chelts, in úrs Gâls, þe þird. Âll þese differ from ǽç øþér in languaȝe, customs and lâs. Þe river Garonne separates þe Gâls from þe Aquitani; þe Marne and þe Seine separate þem from þe Belgae. Of âll þese, þe Belgae ar þe bravest, becâs þej ar farþest from þe civilísátîon and refinement of [úr] Province, and merçants lǽst frequently resort tó þem and import þose þings whiç tend tó effeminate þe mind; and þej ar þe nǽrest tó þe Ᵹermans, who dwell bejond þe Rhine, wiþ whom þej ar continually waᵹing wâr; for whiç rǽsøn þe Helvetii âlsô surpass þe rest of þe Gâls in valør, as þej contend wiþ þe Ᵹermans in âlmôst dáily battles, þemselves waᵹe wâr on þeir frontiers. Óan part of þese, whiç it has bén sæd þat þe Gâls occjupý, takes its beginning at þe river Rhone; it is búnded bý þe river Garonne, þe ôsçêan, and þe territørys of þe Belgar: it borders, tóu, on þe side of þe Sequani and þe Helvetii, upon þe river Rhine, and stretçes tówârds þe norþ. Þe Belgar rise from þe extreme frontier of Gâl, extend tó þe lôwer part of þe river Rhine, and lók tówârds þe norþ and þe rising sun. Aquitánia extends from þe river Garonne tó þe Pyrenéan mountains and tó þat part of þe ôsçêan whiç is néar Spáin: it lóks betwén þe setting of þe sun and þe norþ star.</p>
