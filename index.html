	<h2>intro</h2>
	<p>this is a little fun project that I made for memes and giggles.</p>
	<br />
	<h2>but what will be here, you ask?</h2>
	<p>pretty much anything that I can think of, really. or, in other words, if I plan on writing stuff, those intrusive thoughts might appear as a page in this hub.</p>
	<br />
	<h2>how do you use this website?</h2>
	<p>clink on one of the many orange underlined links on the top to go to a subdirectory, or what I like to call <b>interchange stations</b>, which are basically subpages for individual topics are put in a single category (aka the interchange).</p>
	<p>the big title of "silikade" redirects you back to this page.</p>
	<br />
	<h2>Q and A</h2>
	<h3>1. did you learn (a bit of) HTML and CSS just to make this?</h3>
	<p><i>yes. but I am lazy so this is what you get.</i></p>
	<h3>2. did you make a github account just for this?</h3>
	<p><i>also yes.</i></p>
	<h3>3. is this going to be updated?</h3>
	<p><i>maybe, if I have time.</i></p>
	<br />
	<h2>coming soon (if I actually bother to update this thing)</h2>
	<p>stuff about a fantasy world</p>
	<p>history stuff and photography</p>
	<p>a bit more content</p>
	<br />
	<h2>inspiration (credits)</h2>
	<p>the idea of a personal webpage: LΛMPLIGHT (very cool conlang and microtonal music maker), jan Misali (also the inspiration for white text on black background), and countless other personal blogs online</p>
	<p>youtube: various tutorials on HTML and CSS, lol</p>
	<p>information sources: stack exchange, reddit, wikipedia, etc.</p>
