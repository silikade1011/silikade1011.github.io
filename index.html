	<h2>intro</h2>
	<p>this is but a little fun april fools project that I made for memes and giggles.</p>
	<br />
	<h2>but what will be here, you ask?</h2>
	<p>pretty much everything that I can think of, really.</p>
	<p>as long as this site gets maintained, I might post stuff on here every now and then.</p>
	<br />
	<h2>guide</h2>
	<p>this is the main page. Clink on one of the orange (underlined) links on the top to go to a page that you want.</p>
	<p>the big title of "silikade" redirects you back to this page.</p>
	<p>many of the top links lead into what I like to call <b>interchange stations</b>, which are basically subpages for individual topics are put in a single category (aka the interchange).</p>
	<br />
	<h2>Q and A</h2>
	<h3>1. did you learn (a bit of) HTML and CSS just to make this?</h3>
	<p><i>yes. but I am lazy so this is what you get.</i></p>
	<h3>2. is this going to be updated?</h3>
	<p><i>probably? I am not good at this lol</i></p>
	<br />
