	<h2>areas of triangles</h2>
	<p>Someone once presented me with a question:</p>
	<p><i>A triangle has sides of lengths 29, 29, and 40. Find another isosceles triangle with the same perimeter and area that also has sides of integral lengths.</i></p>
	<p>Additionally, I was requested to find the general solution to this type of problem, with an isosceles triangle of base 2x and height y.</p>
	<p>Interestingly enough, this delves into some crazy relations with cubics, the difference of squares theorem, and sine rules.</p>
	<br />
	<h2>solving the original problem</h2>
	<h3><u>1. Splitting and setting variable</u></h3>
	<p>We split the original triangle in half down the 40 side, giving us 2 triangles of [20, 21, 29]. (21 is derived from the Pythagorean theorem, aka the height.)</p>
	<p>The area (A) of the whole triangle is 420 (units sq.), and the perimeter (P) is 98.</p>
	<p>Suppose we have another isosceles triangles with the same A and P. Naturally we can divide it into 2 right-angled triangles.</p>
	<p>Let the side lengths be [a, b, √(a² + b²)] (without loss of generality, we let 2a be the length of a side, aka this triangle has sides [2a, √(a² + b²), √(a² + b²)].)</p>
	<h3><u>2. Setting up equations</u></h3>
	<p>We have:</p>
	<p>ab = 420, aka a = 420/b</p>
	<p>2a + 2√(a² + b²) = 98, aka a + √(a² + b²) = 49, which can be re-written:</p>
	<p>√(a² + b²) = 49 - a</p>
	<p>a² + b² = A² - 98a + 2401</p>
	<p>b² = 2401 - 98a</p>
	<h3><u>3. The math</u></h3>
	<p>Subbing a = 420/b:</p>
	<p>b² = 2401 - 98(420/b)</p>
	<p>b³ = 2401b - 41160</p>
	<p>b³ - 2401b + 41160 = 0</p>
	<p>Look, a depressed cubic. Fortunately, we know that b = 21 (i.e. a = 20) is one of its solutions.</p>
	<p>Hence, we can factorize the polynomial without going through the need of cubic solving:</p>
	<p>(b - 21)(b² + 21b - 1960) = 0</p>
	<p>(b - 21)(b - 35)(b + 56) = 0</p>
	<p>b = 21 (original), b = 35 (hence a = 12), b = -56 (rejected)</p>
	<p>Subbing the other value of b, we get the solution [24, 37, 37].</p>
	<br />
	<h2>so what about the general case?</h2>
	<p>I did promise the requester, so here it is. For an isosceles triangle of base 2x units and height y units:</p>
	<h3><u>1. Setting variables</u></h3>
	<p>A = xy and P = 2x + 2√(x² + y²).</p>
	<p>Suppose we have another triangle [2m, √(m² + n²), √(m² + n²)]. Then we have A = mn and P = 2m + 2√(m² + n²).</p>
	<h3><u>2. Equations</u></h3>
	<p>From the above, we have n = A/m and 2√(m² + n²) = P - 2m</p>
	<p>Rewriting a bit:</p>
	<p>4(m² + n²) = P² - 4Pm + 4m²</p>
	<p>4(A/m)² = P² - 4Pm</p>
	<p>4Pm³ - P²m² + 4A² = 0; a cubic <i>in terms of m</i>.</p>
	<h3><u>3. Solving the cubic</u></h3>
	<p>Since (x, y) (aka m = x) is a solution, we can simplify the cubic directly.</p>
	<p>Alternately, one can derive a cubic in terms of n and use the solution n = y to simplify it as well.</p>
	<br />
	<h2>another example</h2>
	<p>Suppose we have x = 33, y = 56 (√(x² + y²) = √(33² + 56²) = 65.), getting us a triangle of [66, 65, 65], where A = 33x56 = 1848, P = 66 + 65 + 65 = 196.</p>
	<p>Making the substitutions:</p>
	<p>4(196)m³ - 196²m² + 4(1848²) = 0</p>
	<p>196m³ - 9604m² + 1848² = 0</p>
	<p>m³ - 49m² + 17424 = 0</p>
	<p>(m - 33)(m² - 16m - 528) = 0</p>
	<p>m = 33 is the only integer root, meaning that for this particular area and perimeter, [66, 65, 65] is the only isosceles triangle with integer side lengths.</p>
	<br />
	<h2>a special case of irrational area and perimeter</h2>
	<p>Notice how we didn't set y as a side? That means y can be a non-integer.</p>
	<p>e.g. for x = 2 and y = 3√13 (aka √(x² + y²) = 11):</p>
	<p>A = 2(3√13) = 6√13, and P = 4 + 11 + 11 = 26</p>
	<p>Suppose another triangle 2m, √(m² + n²), √(m² + n²) has the same area and perimeter as above.</p>
	<h3><u>Equation time</u></h3>
	<p>4(26)m³ - 26²m² + 4(6√13)² = 0</p>
	<p>104m³ - 676m² + 1872 = 0</p>
	<p>2m³ - 13m² + 36 = 0</p>
	<p>(m - 2)(2m² - 9m - 18) = 0</p>
	<p>(m - 2)(2m + 3)(m - 6) = 0</p>
	<p>We get m = 2 (original), m = -1.5 (rejected), or m = 6.</p>
	<p>In the case of m = 6, n = √13, and √(m² + n²) = √(36 + 13) = 7. 
		Hence a [7, 7, 12] triangle has the same area and perimeter as a [11, 11, 4] triangle.</p>
	<br />
	<h2>extras: generation of differences of squares and pythagorean triples</h2>	
	<p>Using the example directly above, suppose θ is the angle between [7, 7], and φ is the angle between [11, 11].</p>
	<p>By the sine area theorem, we know that A = 49sinθ/2 = 121sinφ/2.</p>
	<p>Also, cosθ = (49 + 49 - 144)/(2x7x7) = -23/49 and cosφ = (121 + 121 - 16)/(2x11x11) = 113/121.</p>
	<p>Consequently, sin²θ = 1 - (-23/49)² = 1872/2401, and sin²φ = 1 - (113/121)² = 1872/14641. Notice how <b>1872</b> is the numerator of both fractions. In fact:</p>
	<p>A² = 2401sin²θ/4 = 2401(1872)/(4)(2401) = 468. At the same time, A² = 14641sin²φ/4 = 14641(1872)/(4)(14641) = 468.</p>
	<p>Hence, we can derive 2 different ways of writing 1872 as difference of squares: <b>1872 = 49² - 23² = 121² - 113²</b>. In the case of a square number, we will end up generating a Pythagorean triple.</p>
