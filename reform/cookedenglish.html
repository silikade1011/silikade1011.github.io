	<h2>what is cooked english?</h2>
	<p><i>Cooked English (CE; *Cóked Énglisç in CE)</i> is a system I designed as a fun little project/challenge to fix English spelling.</p>
	<p>If you have read <a href="spellingreform.html">this</a>, then you know English spelling sucks. This is a representation of what a hypothetical spelling reform can look like.</p>
	<p>I do not intend this to be used as an "official" spelling reform, in the sense that I expect people to adapt to it.</p>
	<h3>Goals:</h3>
	<p>1. Make English spelling more consistent</p>
	<p>2. Maintain word relations. Honestly, etymology is a secondary concern since for many other languages, words get nativized to their own spelling rules when adapted.</p>
	<br />
	<h2>The writing system</h2>
	<p>CE uses all of the standard 26 letters.</p>
	<h3><b><u>1. New letters</u></b></h3>
	<p>Þ: thorn (þorn). This letter was used in Old English (alongside Ð, eth) to spell the sounds we now spell as "th": the voiceless and voiced dental fricatives.</p>
	<p>Ç: çe (che). This is used in e.g. French to denote a /s/ before back vowels, and e.g. Turkish to denote /tʃ/. This letter will be used in the same way as in Turkish to write "ch".</p>
	<p>Ᵹ: ᵹe (je). This letter was a variant letter "g" in olden times. Here it is used to write /dʒ/, commonly represented by "g", "dg", and "j".</p>
	<p>Ȝ: joȝ (yogh). This letter was also a "g" variant, but simplified in writing. Here it represents the remnants of "gh" that has gone silent (in fact, this letter is also used to write that sound in Middle English), and to transcribe the "ch" in Scottish "loch".</p>
	<p>Æ: asç (ash). This letter will be used to denote "ea" (or sometimes "a") when pronounced /ɛ/, which is also the same sound it makes in Norwegian.</p>
	<p>Ø: øþel (erthel). This letter commonly represents /ø/, but it is similar enough to English /ɝ/ that I will use it to write "o" in -or words when pronounced that way. It also represents /ʌ/ in certain situations.</p>
	<p>For Ȝ and Ᵹ, they are interchangeable with G under some words, e.g. síȝn (sign) but signature.</p>
	<p>Optionally:</p>
	<p>Ŋ can be used as an abbreviation for "ng".</p>
	<p>Ð can be used as an alternative to Þ.</p>
	<br />
	<h3><b><u>2. Consonant use changes</u></b></h3>
	<p>J will solely be used for /j/, with no exceptions. In fact, J does come from the usage of "I" as a semi-vowel, and is such in many Germanic and Slavic languages. Additionally, we also have the example of /dʒ/ being spelt as "gi" in Italian, sometimes in words derived from /j/ in Latin itself, showing that such a change in spelling is possible.</p>
	<p>G will solely be used for /g/; there's no such thing as a soft "g" anymore. Hard and soft C will be kept.</p>
	<p>The sound for "sh" /ʃ/ is now written "SÇ"; by analogy, the sound /ʒ/ is written "ZꝽ" (basically the voiced equivalent of /ʃ/). </p>
	<p>"CH" now represents /k/ (aspirated or not) in all locations, and "TH" now represents /t/.</p>
	<br />
	<h3><b><u>3. The vowel system</u></b></h3>
	<p><b>a. The schwa</b></p>
	<p>Just leave it there. There's no need to rewrite it because of its prevalence, and because some people read schwas as their original vowel anyway.</p>
	<p><b>b. A full chart of vowels (notated in RP pronunciation. Schwas are not included here.)</b></p>

	<p><b>d. Other vowel changes</b></p>
	<p>ei = /e, ə, ɪ/ is changed to "e" or "i".</p>
	<p>ȩ is used to denote a silent e (that is not a vowel_e combo), and to make the preceding C soft. For example, façade becomes "facȩad", and limaçon becomes "limacȩon".</p>
	<p>ê also makes the preceding C hard, e.g. Celt becomes "Cêlt".</p>
	<p>ocean is spelt "ôsçȩan" to better match with "ôsçéanic" (oceanic).</p>
	<p>one is written as "óan".</p>

	<h2>sample text</h2>
	<h3><u>Opening text of a translated version of De Bello Gallico by Julius Caesar</u></h3>
	<p>Âll Gâl is divided intó þré parts, óan of whiç þe Belgæ inhabit, þe Aquitani anøþer, 
		þose whó in þeir ôn languaȝe ar called Cêlts, in úrs Gâls, þe þird. 
		Âll þese differ from ǽç øþér in languaȝe, customs and lâs. 
		Þe river Garonnȩ separates þe Gâls from þe Aquitani; 
		þe Marnȩ and þe Seinȩ separate þem from þe Belgæ. 
		Of âll þese, þe Belgæ ar þe bravest, becâs þej ar farþest from þe civilísátîon and refinement of [úr] Provincȩ, 
		and merçants lǽst frequently resort tó þem and import þose þings whiç tend tó effeminate þe mind; 
		and þej ar þe nǽrest tó þe Ᵹermans, who dwell bejond þe Rhine, wiþ whom þej ar continually waᵹing wâr; 
		for whiç rǽsøn þe Helvetii âlsô surpass þe rest of þe Gâls in valør, as þej contend wiþ þe Ᵹermans in âlmôst dáily battles, 
		þemselvs waᵹe wâr on þeir frontiers. Óan part of þese, whiç it has bén sæd þat þe Gâls occjupý, 
		takes its beginning at þe river Rhone; it is búnded bý þe river Garonnȩ, 
		þe ôsçȩan, and þe territørys of þe Belgæ: it borders, toó, on þe side of þe Sequani and þe Helvetii, 
		upon þe river Rhine, and stretçes tówârds þe norþ. Þe Belgæ rise from þe extreme frontier of Gâl, 
		extend tó þe lôwer part of þe river Rhine, and lók tówârds þe norþ and þe rising sun. 
		Aquitánia extends from þe river Garonnȩ tó þe Pyrenéan mountains and tó þat part of þe ôsçȩan whiç is nǽr Spáin: 
		it lóks betwén þe setting of þe sun and þe norþ star.</p>

	<h2>currently unresolved problems</h2>
	<p>Not all of U_E is /ju/, in words such as "include", "protrude", etc. Additionally, /ju/ also appears as "u" in some words, such as "occupy", "calculator". This will need a proper representation.</p>
	<p>Homographs in CE: e.g. to vs. too, which both become "tó" (I have written "too" as "toó" above, though it is not a perfect solution.)</p>
	<p>Other silent letters?</p>
