	<h2>what is cooked english?</h2>
	<p><i>Cooked English (CE; Cóoked Énglisċ in CE)</i> is a system I designed as a fun little attempt to fix English spelling.</p>
	<p>If you have read <a href="spellingreform.html">this</a>, then you know English spelling sucks. This is a representation of what a hypothetical spelling reform can look like.</p>
	<p>I do not intend this to be used as an "official" spelling reform, in the sense that I expect people to adapt to it.</p>
	<h3>Goals:</h3>
	<p>1. Make English spelling more consistent</p>
	<p>2. Maintain word relations. Though etymology is a secondary concern since there are many examples of words getting nativized in the spelling rules of many other languages.</p>
	<br />
	<h2>The writing system</h2>
	<p>CE uses all of the standard 26 letters.</p>
	<h3><b><u>1. New independent letters</u></b></h3>
	<p>a. Þ (thorn)</p>
	<p>Thorn was once used in Old English (alongside Ð, eth) to spell the sounds we now spell as "th": the voiceless and voiced dental fricatives. It still has use in Icelandic to represent the same sounds.</p>
	<p>In this reform, it will replace all instances of "th" which represent the dental fricatives. "th" represents /t/ instead.</p>
	<p>b. Ċ</p>
	<p>Ċ is used to mark a "C" pronounced as /tʃ/ in modern usage representing Old English orthography, and is also currently used in Maltese for the same sound (in fact, it only as Ċ, not plain C).</p>
	<p>In this reform, it will replace all instances of "ch" which represent /tʃ/.</p>
	<p>-tch and sh are re-written "-tċ" and "sċ" respectively.</p>
	<p>c. Ġ</p>
	<p>Ġ is used in the romanization of several languages to denote /ɣ/. But since we don't have native /ɣ/ in English, we will repurpose this instead.</p>
	<p>Instead, this letter is now to replace all the silent "gh"s (and sometimes G's as well).</p>
	<p>As a sidenote to silent letters, most silent consonants are NOT dropped, except for many of the silent Ses and Ts, which are re-written.</p>
	<p>d. Ʒ</p>
	<p>I wanted to use insular G for this, but since it is not supported in lots of platforms (especially the uppercase), I will use ezh instead.</p>
	<p>Ʒ denotes /dʒ/, and replaces ordinary English J and soft G (as -ge, -dge, whatever). /ʒ/ is written "zʒ" in analogy to "sċ" above.</p>
	<p>Note that for Ʒ and Ġ, they may interchange with G under some related words, e.g. síġn (sign) but signature., rag but raʒe (rage).</p>
	<p>e. Ψ</p>
	<p>This is a direct borrowing from the Greek alphabet, and is used to represent -pse and ps-.</p>
	<br />
	<h3><b><u>2. Consonant use changes</u></b></h3>
	<p><b>a. J and G</b></p>
	<p>J will only be for /j/, with no exceptions. In fact, J comes from the usage of "I" as /j/, and is such in many Germanic and Slavic languages.</p>
	<p>Additionally, we also have the example of /dʒ/ being spelt as "gi" in Italian, sometimes in words derived from /j/ in Latin itself, just as "proof" that stuff can be respelt without completely relying on etymology.</p>
	<p>G now represents only hard /g/, so the soft g convention is now gone. "ng" remains /ŋ/.</p>
	<p><b>b. Hard and soft C, and CH</b></p>
	<p>This convention will be kept, with standardized spelling as follows:</p>
	<p>- hard C /k/ is written C or CH before A, O, U; and CH only before E, I, Y.</p>
	<p>- if a lone C is hard before a E, then we write the E as Ê.</p>
	<p>- soft C /s/ is written C before E, I, Y; and Ç before A, O, U.</p>
	<p>"ch" is treated as one unit representing /k/, and rarely /x/ in words such as loch. in "yacht" where it is silent, it is re-written H, i.e. "jaht".</p>
	<p><b>c. the letter Ç</b></p>
	<p>The standard usage of Ç as /s/ will be kept. This reform extend the usage of this letter by a few metrics:</p>
	<p>- -ç and -sç now replace instances of -ce and -se (or -ice and -ise when necessary) when it is pronounced /s/. For example, fenç (fence), ċanç (chance), nôtiç (notice) [related to nôtiçable (noticeable)]</p>
	<p>- the combination "çi" represents /ʃ/, and replaces word-initial "ch" and "ci" spelt that way, such as in çief (chef), çialê (chalet).</p>
	<p>- the above rule also has the implication of re-writting all suffixes with /ʃə/ as some combination of "çi". This, along with its voiced analog "ʒi", is used in a variety of suffixes:</p>

	<p>The usage of Q and G are changed slightly:</p>

	<p>- “qu” as /k/ is spelt “qų”, and silent U in gu- before E, I, Y are dropped.</p>

	<p><b>b. General vowel digraph rules</b></p>
	<p>If the first vowel has an accent, and the second does NOT, then pronounce the digraph as if it only has the first grapheme.</p>
	<p>If the second vowel has an accent, and the first does NOT, then pronounce the digraph as usual (it is designed such that usually the sound of the first vowel gets assimilated into the second, accented, vowel.)</p>
	<p>If both vowels have accents, then pronounce both of the vowels.</p>
