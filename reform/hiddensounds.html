	<h2>what? there are "hidden" sounds of English?</h2>
	<p>There are many sounds in English; we all know the traditional 44 phonemes of Received Pronunciation. You may have at some point seen a chart like this:</p>
	<img src="rpfoneme.jpg" alt="RP Phonemes">
	<p>But of course, in daily speech, we often don't hear all 44 sounds, or some sounds sound completely foreign or different to us. Why is so?</p>
	<br />
	<h2>allophones</h2>
	<h3><u>what are allophones?</u></h3>
	<p>Allophones are basically slightly different ways of pronouncing the same phoneme in any language. These may or may not be reflected in spellings of words.</p>
	<p>Usually, replacing one allophone with another won't make you sound weird, but people can easily spot the non-native.</p>
	<p>In fact, there are many sorts of allophonic variation in English:</p>
	<h3><u>1. Word-position</u></h3> 
	<p>For example, the aspirated /t/ in "tick" and the unaspirated /t/ in "stick" are allophones. In fact, they exist in complementary distribution, where allophones of a phoneme specifically fall on different positions in a word.</p>
	<p>Using the above example, aspirated p, t, k(also spelt c) usually only appear at start of words, while their unaspirated variants usually appear in the middle of words, or in consonant clusters, such as /sp/, /st/, or /sk/.</p>
	<p>We still spell them as p, t, k(c), but they sound more like b, d, g instead.</p>
	<p>However, these 2 terms are not mutually inclusive: /h/ usually appears word-initially and /ŋ/ word-finally, so we can say that they are in complementary distribution, but they don't sound like one another, and they are regarded as separate phonemes, not allophones.</p>
	<h3><u>2. Adjacent sounds</u></h3>
	<p>Sometimes, allophones happen when a sound is influenced by a sound after or before it.</p>
	<p>In English, and in many other languages, sounds such as /k/ or /t/ get palatalized (slightly or fully) when followed by a front vowel (i, e, etc.), or /j/, which is the semi-vowel we usually spell as "y".</p>
	<p>This results in /kʲ/ and /tʲ/, with some even going to /tʃ/, such as in Tuesday becoming "Chewsday". This latter form is also known as yod-coalescence, which also happens when /j/ follows /s/, /z/, and /d/, such as in sure (shur), azure (azhur), and dune (june, making it homophonous with the month June).</p>
	<h3><u>3. The rhotic</u></h3>
	<p>The "rhotic" reflects how the letter "r" is pronounced in English dialects. Traditionally it is usually represented as /ɹ/, or just /r/ (because there's really only one consonantal R in English), but there's a lot of variation involved.</p>
	<p>Word-initially, it may be /ɹ̠ʷ/ (labialized variant), /r/ (trilled, especially in conservative English varieties, also known as the haha Spanish "perro" thing", and /ɾ/, which does NOT come from an R, but from a reduced /t/ or /d/.</p>
	<p>A sidenote, /t/ also often gets glottalized into /ʔ/, resulting in the infamous "Bri'ish" phoneme, though that also exists in e.g. uh-oh.</p>
	<p>Additionally, word-final R's in -ar, -er, -or, etc. often get dropped as well, leaving a long vowel in its place.</p>
	<br />
	<h2>Marginal phonemes</h2>
	<h3><u>1. /ʒ/</u></h3>
	<p>This is NOT a marginal phoneme, but I put it here because oddly enough, we don't have a standardized way to spell /ʒ/ in native English words (compare sh (or ci, si, ti)= /ʃ/, ch = /tʃ/, j = /dʒ/), though we do treat it as a fully-fledges phoneme of its own right.</p>
	<p>This is because /ʒ/ does appear as voicings of /ʃ/ in certain conditions, such as between vowels, e.g. vision = /'vɪʒən/.</p>
	<p>And there are cases where /ʃ/ and /ʒ/ form a minimal pair (2 words where only one phoneme is different), e.g. Confucian (with /ʃ/) and confusion (with /ʒ/).</p>
	<p>But since /ʒ/ is almost never explicitly spelt uniformly or used in common words., it often gets forgotten as a phoneme.</p>
	<p>Though the good news for /ʒ/ is, it does exist in more "specialist" words, such as genre /ʒɒn.rə/ and beige /beɪʒ/.</p>
	<p>Also, recent slang and loanwords from languages which prominently feature /ʒ/ with its own letter have cause /ʒ/ to appear independently or in other positions, such as zhuzh /ʒʊʒ/ (meaning similarly to "tune up") or the Russian name Zhukov /ʒuːkɒf/. And in various reading aids, /ʒ/ is spelt as "zh", reflecting its rise as a more important phoneme.</p>
	<p>In fact, voiced phonemes arising as independent phonemes from their voiceless counterparts has also occurred throughout the development of English.</p>
	<p>This mainly involves /v/, /z/, and /ð/, which were just allophones of /f/, /s/, and /θ/ respectively in the past and are spelt with the same letter (/θ/ can be spelt with both þ and ð).</p>
	<p>However, with words imported from French coming into English, the first 2 became independent phonemes and got their own letters, while /ð/ just arose by itself for whatever reason.</p>
	<h3><u>2. /x/</u></h3>
	<p>Haha, funny Scottich loch. However, /x/ <i>is</i> how the sound is represented in IPA.</p>
	<p>It has a voiced equivalent too, /ɣ/, which is the "funny dutch "g"" phoneme, and is somewhat difficult for English learners to pronounce without butchering it. </p>
	<p>Nowadays it mainly comes from foreign words and names, such as the German Bach. Many people read this as a /k/, and /x/ is often notated as "kh" in reading guides. But the story goes deeper than that.</p>
	<p>There are 2 main sources of /x/ in the past:</p>
	<p>a. Loanwords from Greek containing the letter χ, which is read as /x/ in Modern Greek. This is also why some words containing "ch" are pronouned as /k/.</p>
	<p>b. "gh" in Middle English, which gradually got lost and now is "silent" in Modern English.</p>
	<p>Eventually both forms were lost and got assimilated into our current existing phonemes.</p>
	<h3><u>3. /ʍ/</u></h3>
	<p>You may encounter some people who pronounce "wh" words with a "h" before the "w". Why is that?</p>
	<p>The phoneme /ʍ/ is why, or should I say, "hwy". </p>
	<p>In the olden days, /ʍ/, the voiceless equivalent of /w/, was spelt with "hw", but then they flipped the letters, which is where we get "wh" today.</p>
	<p>In many dialects, /ʍ/ got assimilated into /w/, resulting in "w" and "wh" sounding the same. But many others do still retain a "h"-ish sound before "w" in wh (or, /ʍ/), distinguishing "wh" from "w".</p>
	<h3><u>4. /ɫ/</u></h3>
	<p>Some people would argue this to be an allophone of /l/ (or, the pronunciation of the letter L), as it mostly appears in word-final positions (spelt -l or -ll).</p>
	<p>However, it is very much worth mentioning this phoneme separately, because for some people /ɫ/ appears under influence of some vowels, and the sound is distinct enough from /l/ (try to read it!) that it might as well be counted as a phoneme, much like /ŋ/.</p>
	<h3><u>5. /e/ and /o/</u></h3>
	<p>Now you often hear foreigners complaining how /e/ and /o/ gets butchered by English speakers, often as /ej/ and /oʊ/.</p>
	<p>English does not have native /e/ and /o/, only the diphthongs, so when people try to read foreign words they nativize the pronunciations, resulting in the "unnatural" diphthongs (which I guess are more "natural" for English speakers).</p>
	<p>Many French and Italian words contain /e/ and /o/, and often contrast them with /ɛ/ and /ɔ/ respectively too, but this distinction is relatively small, so to compensate or to amplify the difference, diphthonization happens.</p>
	<h3><u>6. /ɲ/ and /ʎ/</u></h3>
	<p>This is mostly a result of coalesence of /j/ with a preceding /n/ and /l/, such as in canyon and million.</p>
	<p>However, /ɲ/ and /ʎ/ are not exactly the same to /nj/ and /lj/, and many languages do contrast them, such as in Spanish (heck, they even have ñ as an independent letter) and Italian (compare "gn" with "n" and "gli" with "li").</p>
	<p>/ɲ/ is especially special because we have imported many Spanish words with ñ, and canon does distinct with canyon.</p>
	<p>Special mention also goes to /c/ and /ɟ/, which are palatalized variants of /k/ (/t/) and /g/ (/d/) respectively and appear in many languages as well.</p>
