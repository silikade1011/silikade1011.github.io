	<h2>introduction</h2>
	<p>English spelling sucks: inconsistencies and imperfections galore, we all know that.</p>
	<p>You've probably heard of the sentence "It shouldn't be that tough through thorough thought, though", referencing mess that is the pronunciation of "ough".</p>
	<p>Therefore, some people have called for a reform of English spelling (ESRs), which has gained various levels of traction over history.</p>
	<p>With the Internet, it's now way easier to make and post a spelling reform on, say, Reddit, and let other people decide whether it is kek or cringe.</p>
	<br />
	<h2>a brief history of English and its spelling</h2>
	<p>English is classified as a West Germanic language. Many of the most common words we use come from Old English, and it shares many things with other Germanic languages, and it is possible to construct sentences in those languages which match the format of English grammar, such as in this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryVG5LHRMJ4">Universal Germanic Dialogue</a></p>
	<p>However, it has gained tons of influence from Latin, various stages of French, Greek, etc, and as a result, the weirdness in English spelling is mainly due to its fossilization after the introduction of dictionaries and the printing press, which caused it to remain stuck in the way words are spelt in Middle English.</p>
	<p>As various sound shifts (mainly the Great Vowel Shift) set in, spelling became outdated when compared to modern pronunciations. For example, the words "meat" and "meet" were pronounced /mɛːt/ and /meːt/ a couple of centuries ago, but sound shifts have since made them sound the same (/miːt/, or /mɪjt/).</p>
	<p>Furthermore, spelling got complicated by medieval scribes wanting to relate English words back to its roots, with varying degrees of consistency and correctness.</p>
	<p>The word "debt" was originally spelt "det/dette", but the "b" was added to link it back to Latin "debitum". "Island" got its silent "s" as it was believed that it came from Latin "insula" (WRONG!), also in analogy with "isle".</p>
	<p>Some recent loanwords have kept their original spelling, disregarding regular "rules" of English pronunciation. For example, the "j" in joy, fjord, Jacque (a French name) and jalapeño all have different pronunciations: /dʒ/, /j/, /ʒ/, /x/ respectively.</p>
	<p>All of this are reasons for English spelling and words to be so wacky today.</p>
	<br />
	<h2>general arguments for reform</h2>
	<h3><b><u>1. Reduction of learning time</u></b></h3>
	<p>You can see examples of English learners complaining that English spelling is a mess. For example, look at the "ea" of idea, great, lead (noun), and lead (verb).</p>
	<p>One argument that promotes ESRs is that it helps learners master the language more easily, and utilize it more globally, aka people can guess the pronunciation of an unfamiliar word more easily without going through tons of guesswork and exceptions.</p>
	<h3><b><u>2. Saves costs</u></b></h3>
	<p>In the olden days, and actually now still, books are one of the main forms by which learners can get a grasp of what English is like.</p>
	<p>Supporters of ESRs hope to save printing costs by eliminating digraphs and letters that supporters deem "redundant", such as silent letters. For example, "the" may be spelt like "þe" (this is the letter "thorn"), which is around a 33% decrease in length.</p>
	<br />
	<h2>general arguments against reform</h2>
	<h3><b><u>1. Dialects</u></b></h3>
	<p>This is arguably the most vocal camp out of all that are against English spelling reforms. Unfortunately, there is no one unitary organization that governs and maintains English spelling, even in present time, unlike French and German.</p>
	<p>With the British Empire colonizing every rock in existence, English is now the de facto global lingua franca. and many speakers develop their own dialects. We have a term for that: an "idiolect", the way that a certain person speaks.</p>
	<p>For example, some people may pronounce the "a" in "bath" as /ɑ/, while others as /æ/; and some people may coalesce yods (y's) or glottalize their t's, which is why stuff like "Chewsday" or "bo'ol o' wo'er" exist.</p>
	<p>Henceforth, opponents of ESRs argue that it's hard to make a reform that accommodates all dialects., thus making English learning and communication harder.</p>
	<p>Additionally, since English spelling was standardized so long ago, people will also say that its spelling, though broken, is as fine as it is, as long as it is understandable. Most people in the planet would have already remembered it, and thus a change will just disrupt them all, as people wil have to relearn spelling.</p>
	<h3><b><u>2. Etymology</u></b></h3>
	<p>Throughout history English has brought in a lot of words outside their own Germanic roots, which over time has their spellings nativized, but then the scribes came in and also started relinking them back to their Latin or Greek roots, for example.</p>
	<p>It is thus argued that keeping the current spelling reflects its origin, helping learners understand where it came from, like the debt and isle examples above.</p>
	<p>Additionally, people would complain that reforms can cause word links to be lost, which hinders learners from understanding word relations. "g" is silent in "sign", but is read in "signature" (notice how the "i" is also read differently in the 2 words.)</p>
	<br />
	<h2>types of English spelling reforms: pros and cons</h2>
	<h3><b><u>1. Large overhauls</u></b></h3>
	<p>In this case, ESR makers aim to make English spelling follow the alphabetic principle, i.e. "one letter, one sound."</p>
	<p>This may involve adding diacritics or accent marks, getting rid of silent letters in words, borrowing letters from other languages, or even completely inventing a new way of writing which matches the phonemic inventory of the English language.</p>
	<p>Sometimes, common digraphs may also be used, such as making "ch" always /tʃ/ and not /k/ as in many Greek-derived words.</p>
	<p>Often times, one can easily derive pronunciation from spelling (and vice versa), so they are some of the most effective orthographies for writing as one or more graphemes correspond to one sound and only one sound.</p>
	<p>However, because they also don't care about the expectation of people using the system, so these are also the least effective in terms of actual implementation, mostly because of resistance to change and etymological reasons. Learning a whole system from the ground up can be hard man.</p>
	<h3><b><u>2. Simple patches</u></b></h3>
	<p>Here, small patches and fixes are made to target certain minor irregularities in English spelling, like the replacement of "ph" by "f", "ae" and "oe" by "e".</p>
	<p>These reforms have mostly the opposite effect to those in the first category, in that they are very implementable if introduced to a general population, and in many cases etymology is largely left intact, but less effective when it comes to phonemic spelling.</p>
	<p>Indeed, the stereotypical American style of dropping "u" from "colour" and "favourite" or changing "re" to "er" in some words are derived from a reform like this.</p>
	<p>Additionally, nowadays slang terms sometimes also represent this type of reform by shortening certain words, such as "thru" for "through" or "tho" for "though". So, though not officially implemented at this moment, you're contributing to spelling reform by typing your weird slangs!</p>
	<h3><b><u>3. A mix of 1 and 2</u></b></h3>
	<p>Of course, ESRs are actually a spectrum, and many have a mix of properties, which is why there are so many of them and each one of them is unique.</p>
	<p>A good ESR can achieve both (near-)perfect phonemicality and practicality, while a bad ESR loses at both categories and makes everything confusing. </p>
	<br />
	<h2>but why do most English spelling reforms suck, or fail?</h2>
	<h3><b><u>1. Expectations</u></b></h3>
	<p>Many ESR makers often present a "this spelling will become the new standard" argument, based on the amount of benefits it has. While this is made so that ESRs have a purpose and justification of being made, it is practically impossible.</p>
	<p>Unless you're Noah Webster, or you somehow manage to get a large percentage of people in English-speaking countries to agree with your reform, yeah good luck.</p>
	<p>In general, ESRs are more of a design challenge, where one looks at English spelling and think "how should we fix it?". But due to the many irregularies of English, one may encounter a lot of obstacles left and right, some of which are way worse than our current spelling, and consequently many spelling reforms eventually fail.</p>
	<p>Additionally, a personal rant, but <i>please</i> find a sample text of your own. The UDHR and the North Wind and the Sun, though good sample texts, are getting lame, and don't address all problems of English orthography.</p>
	</p><h3><b><u>2. Dialects</u></b></h3>
	<p>ESRs often have to accommodate for dialectal variation; often at least Received Pronunciation and General American are considered as they are the 2 most discussed (and prestigious) types of English.</p> 
	<p>But there are too many types of English out there such that it's impossible to standardize to one dialect without others losing their qualities.</p>
	<p>If we try to make spelling accommodate to dialects (such as adding diacritics), writing can get very messy, as people will have to memorize all the spellings from different dialects, and even then it could be different among people of the same region.</p>
	<p>Some people go the extra mile and make one dialect the prestige dialect, basing the spellings on how it is read in that dialect, which is just way worse. And RP is already acting like this by having people impose its pronunciation as the "right one" already!</p>
	<h3><b><u>3. The ugly</u></b></h3>
	<p>Some ESRs are just...ugly. Actually, more so clunky instead.</p>
	<p>One aspect often promoted is "ASCII-compatibility", which is to only use ASCII characters: in practice this is our standard 26-letter alphabet.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, with the amount of phonemes in English, it is hard to represent all of them using only ASCII without having it look very ugly or clunky.</p>
	<p>An example of this is "actually": one can spell it "ackchyually", which looks better than "akk-choo-ull-lee".</p>
	<p>However, this type of spelling does gets used in reading guides to help people read ambiguous or difficult words, much like how furigana works in Japanese to help people read kanji.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, people will also start complaining if we add in other diacritics or characters because we're too used to the 26 letters, which boils down to the fact that English is (practically) the ONLY globally important language which rejects (or, to use a nicer term, does not use) accent marks. Out of the 6 working tongues of the UN, Chinese has tones; French, Russian and Spanish (and many other European languages which are not UN working languages) have their tildes and acutes; even Standard Arabic has a lot of dots to help distinguish sounds as an abjad (it used to NOT be official before spelling got standardized.)</p>
	<p>Some people even remove marks from loanwords, such as "facade" for "façade", and people are dropping diacritics for native English words as well, such as "naive" for "naïve" or "co-operate" for "coöperate", which goes on to show that for some people, English (and consequently ESRs) shouldn't even have diacritics. Honestly, that really sucks, you're losing information on word pronunciations (the co-operate example is fine though, ö is used as a different letter altogether in many languages anyway.)</p>
	<p>All in all, it is simply impossible to have a language look "pretty" without it being fully "ASCII-compatible".</p>
	<h3><b><u>4. The schwa (/ə/) and the strut (/ʌ/)</u></b></h3>
	<p>These 2 sounds are often the topic of many discussions in ESRs, and many proposals have been made to "regularize" it. It is useful to explain the origin of these 2 sounds first:</p>
	<p>The schwa is typically a reduced vowel, and many languages do reduce their vowels (e.g. word-final "e" for German), though English does it on a much, <i>much</i> larger scale. Historically, many words ending with "e" became schwas and were then dropped, but the "e" was still written, and vowel changes led to the development of "long vowels" today.</p>
	<p>The strut comes from historical /u/, mostly spelt "u"; but it is also sometimes spelt "o", such as in "love" and "son", originating from the practice of not putting a "u" next to a "v" or "n" in medieval writing, as "u" and "v" were still the same letter and readers will have a hard time reading.</p>
	<p>In the present day, there also exists a "schwa-strut merger", whereby both vowels are pronounced the same.</p>
	<p>One of the methods proposed is to unify the spellings of all schwas (e.g: a, u, or even ə itself), while keeping the strut vowel "u". However, word relations may still be lost: for example "grammar" and "grammatic", which would become *grammə(r) and *grammatik, for example.</p>
	<p>Some people go a step further and write schwa and strut the same way (often also changing other letters), which will make things more of a mess because schwa and strut have different origins, and lots of homoglyphs will be made (as if there weren't enough homophones already, e.g. son and sun), adding a further layer of confusion.</p>
	<h3><b><u>5. The Great Vowel Shift</u></b></h3>
	<p>I would rather call this the "Great Vowel Movement" because V and B are similar in phonetic value (and in other languages they often do shift to one another), and of course the GVS shitted all over the place regarding English vowels.</p>
	<p>There is often a temptation to "preserve" relations between historically "short" and "long" vowels, like how "dress" is short E, and "fleece" or "Pete" is long E.</p>
	<p>Indeed, many "long vowels" do come from vowels that were longer than their short equivalents (like "meet" vs. "met"). Unfortunately, this is often not explained when English is taught to people, unless one's in a literature class, which is why it may seem so weird in the first place when you try to explain that e.g. chivalry and cry rhyme in the Agincourt Carol (cuz they used to be).</p>
	<p>Some believe it is more useful to think of the "fleece" vowel as a longer version of the "kit" vowel (though, for many people, their quality isn't exactly the same either), and that is one way of thinking about it.</p>
	<br />
	<h2>just how many English spelling reforms were there?</h2>
	<p>The answer: a lot. As mentioned, with the Internet many reformers have sprung up and made their own reforms: some are good, some are bad.</p>
	<p>Here are <a href="catalogueofesrs.html">examples of ESRs I found from various sources</a>. Perhaps it is worth checking them out; both their motivation and their reception are useful.</p>
	<p>Heck, even I personally have one: <a href="cookedenglish.html">Cooked English</a>. If you want to know more, feel free to check that out.</p>
