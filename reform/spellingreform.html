	<h2>introduction</h2>
	<p>English spelling sucks: inconsistencies and imperfections galore, we all know that.</p>
	<p>You've probably heard of the sentence "It shouldn't be that tough through thorough thought, though", referencing mess that is the pronunciation of "ough".</p>
	<p>Therefore, some people have called for a reform of English spelling (ESRs), which has gained various levels of traction over history.</p>
	<p>With the Internet, it's now way easier to make and post a spelling reform on, say, Reddit, and let other people decide whether it is kek or cringe.</p>
	<br />
	<h2>a brief history of English and its spelling</h2>
	<p>English is classified as a West Germanic language. Many of the most common words we use come from Old English, and it shares many things with other Germanic languages, and it is possible to construct sentences in those languages which match the format of English grammar, such as in this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryVG5LHRMJ4">Universal Germanic Dialogue</a></p>
	<p>However, it has gained tons of influence from Latin, various stages of French, Greek, etc, and as a result, the weirdness in English spelling is mainly due to its fossilization after the introduction of dictionaries and the printing press, which caused it to remain stuck in the way words are spelt in Middle English.</p>
	<p>As various sound shifts (mainly the Great Vowel Shift) set in, spelling became outdated when compared to modern pronunciations. For example, the words "meat" and "meet" were pronounced /mɛːt/ and /meːt/ a couple of centuries ago, but sound shifts have since made them sound the same (/miːt/, or /mɪjt/).</p>
	<p>Furthermore, spelling got complicated by medieval scribes wanting to relate English words back to its roots, with varying degrees of consistency and correctness.</p>
	<p>The word "debt" was originally spelt "det/dette", but the "b" was added to link it back to Latin "debitum". "Island" got its silent "s" as it was believed that it came from Latin "insula", also in analogy with "isle" (this is, however, incorrect.)</p>
	<p>Some recent loanwords have kept their original spelling, disregarding regular "rules" of English pronunciation. For example, the "j" in joy, fjord, Jacque (a French name) and jalapeño all have different pronunciations: /dʒ/, /j/, /ʒ/, /x/ respectively.</p>
	<p>All of this are reasons for English spelling and words to be so wacky today.</p>
	<br />
	<h2>general arguments for reform</h2>
	<h3><b><u>1. Reduction of learning time</u></b></h3>
	<p>Indeed, learners of English (as a second language other than their native tongue) often find English spelling a mess with its many inconsistencies. For example, one can spot the difference between "ea" of idea, great, lead (noun), and lead (verb).</p>
	<p>One argument that promotes ESRs is that it helps learners master the language more easily, and utilize it more globally, aka people can guess the pronunciation of an unfamiliar word more easily without going through tons of guesswork and exceptions.</p>
	<h3><b><u>2. Saves costs</u></b></h3>
	<p>In the olden days, and actually now still, books are one of the main forms by which learners can get a grasp of what English is like.</p>
	<p>Supporters of ESRs hope to save printing costs by eliminating digraphs and letters that supporters deem "redundant", such as silent letters. For example, "the" may be spelt like "þe" (this is the letter "thorn"), which is around a 33% decrease in length.</p>
	<br />
	<h2>general arguments against reform</h2>
	<h3><b><u>1. Dialects</u></b></h3>
	<p>This is one of the most vocal arguments against English spelling reforms. Unlike e.g. French or German, there is no one unitary organization or advisory body that governs English spelling and make updates to it, even in present time.</p>
	<p>Additionally, with the British Empire colonizing every rock in existence, English is now the de facto lingua franca of the world, and many speakers - both native and learners - have developed their own dialects.</p>
	<p>We have a term for that: an "idiolect", the way that a certain person speaks. And of course, idiolects differ down to individuals.</p>
	<p>For example, some people may pronounce the "a" in "bath" as /ɑ/, while others may read it as /æ/; and some people may coalesce yods (y's) or glottalize their t's, which is why stuff like "Chewsday" or "bo'ol o' wo'er" exist.</p>
	<p>These people would say that ESRs unnecessarily complicates rules and spellings, making the same word spelt differently in different regions, thus making English learning and communication harder.</p>
	<h3><b><u>2. For etymology sake</u></b></h3>
	<p>Other than dialects, ESRs are also likely to get shot down by this reason: etymology.</p>
	<p>Unlike, for example, Standard German or Icelandic, English has brought in a lot of words outside their own Germanic roots from Old English, which over time got their spellings nativized.</p>
	<p>It is thus argued that keeping spelling this way reflects its origin, which helps learners understand where it came from.</p>
	<p>As an example, even though every "c" in Pacific Ocean is spelt differently, "Pacific" comes from a Latin word, while "Ocean" got its pronunciation from Old/Middle French.</p>
	<p>Additionally, ESRs may sometimes cause word links to be lost, which hinders learners from understanding word relations. Take the silent "g" in "sign" as an example; it is still read in "signature" (notice how the "i" is also read differently in the 2 words.)</p>
	<h3><b><u>3. The need of change</u></b></h3>
	<p>The longevity of standardized English spelling coming from the Late Middle Ages causes opponents to state that English spelling is as fine as it is, as long as people understand what you mean.</p>
	<p>Allophonic variation does happen all the time with sounds (like how I mentioned dialects), but variations are still understood as the word is still the same in written form.</p>
	<p>The fact that spelling has stayed largely the same helps as most people in the planet would have already remembered it, and thus no change is needed.</p>
	<br />
	<h2>types of English spelling reforms: pros and cons</h2>
	<h3><b><u>1. Large overhauls</u></b></h3>
	<p>This is one of the most often suggested types of spelling reform. In this case, ESR creators (ESRCs) aim to make English spelling follow the alphabetic principle, i.e. "one letter, one sound."</p>
	<p>This may involve adding diacritics or accent marks, getting rid of silent letters in words, borrowing letters from other languages, or even completely inventing a new way of writing which matches the phonemic inventory of the English language.</p>
	<p>The more loose of the reforms may also conform to English spelling in the use of digraphs with consistent pronunciations, such as "ch" for /tʃ/, not /k/ as in many Greek-derived words.</p>
	<p>Often times, they disregard traditional way of reading English letters, as well as expectation of people using the system, so they are some of the most effective orthographies for writing as one or more graphemes correspond to one sound and only one sound.</p>
	<p>However, these are also the least effective in terms of actual implementation, mostly because people are resistant to change and some also discard etymology, which, as mentioned, makes certain relations lost.</p>
	<p>Nobody wants to learn (or re-learn) a whole new type of alphabet from the ground up.</p>
	<h3><b><u>2. Simple patches</u></b></h3>
	<p>This is the other kind of major reform proposals, in which small patches and fixes are made to target certain minority irregularities in English spelling.</p>
	<p>Such examples include the replacement of "ph" by "f", "ae" and "oe" by "e".</p>
	<p>These reforms have mostly the opposite effect of type 1, in that they are very implementable and effective if introduced to a general population, and in many cases etymology is largely left intact, but less effective when it comes to phonemic spelling.</p>
	<p>Indeed, we did have some reforms of this type which became mainstream spelling, such as dropping "u" from "colour" and "favourite" or changing "re" to "er" in some words. (both are hallmarks of American English today)</p>
	<p>Additionally, nowadays slang terms sometimes also represent this type of reform by shortening certain words, such as "thru" for "through" or "tho" for "though".</p>
	<h3><b><u>3. A mix of 1 and 2</u></b></h3>
	<p>ESRs aren't actually limited to being one of the two kinds mentioned above; it is in fact a spectrum, and many have a mix of properties, which is why there are so many of them and each of them are the same yet so distinct.</p>
	<p>A good ESR can achieve both (near-)perfect phonemicality and practicality, while a bad ESR loses at both categories and makes everything confusing. </p>
	<br />
	<h2>but why do most English spelling reforms suck, or fail?</h2>
	<p>Disclaimer: this is simply my opinion on ESRs. you can decide whether you agree or not.</p>
	<h3><b><u>1. Narcissism</u></b></h3>
	<p>OK, this is not the best word to describe it, but it essentially is how I would describe most ESRs.</p>
	<p>Many ESR creators argue that their way of spelling will become the "new standard", which is...not only biased towards themselves, but also impossible outright.</p>
	<p>Unless you're Noah Webster, or you somehow manage to get a large percentage of government officials and populations in English-speaking countries to agree with your reform, yeah fat chance getting that through.</p>
	<p>In fact, I see many ESRs containing paragraphs going over the potential benefits of the spelling reforms, without acknowledging the many problems of English orthography, or even the creators' own difficulties in making said ESR.</p>
	<p>Now, granted, this is made so that ESRs have a purpose and justification of being made (why else make it?), and yeah. I see ESRs as a fun little design challenge; it's easy to look at English spelling and think "damn it is a mess, how do I fix it?"</p>
	<p>But if the goal is NOT to make your ESR the <i>right</i> way of spelling things, then don't put that on there.</p>
	<p>Additionally, <i>please</i> find a sample text of your own, or even make one yourself; The UDHR and the North Wind and the Sun are getting lame, and don't address all aspects of English orthography, even though they are good sample texts on their own.</p>
	</p><h3><b><u>2. Dialects</u></b></h3>
	<p>Yep, this term again. How are we going to represent a word with slight pronunciation different across dialects of English? Yeah good luck with that.</p>
	<p>Some reforms do accommodate at least Received Pronunciation and General American, which is alright if we think about the fact that RP and GA are the 2 most discussed types of English variations, but the problem is that there are so many types of English out there such that it's impossible to standardize to one dialect without others losing their qualities.</p>
	<p>The drawback of standardizing English spelling to accommodate so many dialects (i.e. one spelling covers all) is that people will have to constantly think how a word is spelt, which currently, English is already doing that.</p>
	<p>The other way to is spell the same word in each dialect differently, which is also a no-go because people will have to memorize all the spellings of that word, and this disuniformity is going to be hard to understand. This <i>was</i> actually the case during Middle English because of writers' idiolects and regional dialects in Britain, which is why spelling got standardized in the first place.</p>
	<p>Some people go the extra mile and make one dialect the prestige dialect, basing the spellings on how it is read in that dialect, which is just way worse. And RP is already doing that for many years pronunciation-wise!</p>
	<h3><b><u>3. The ugly</u></b></h3>
	<p>Honestly, as much as I like ESRs, some of them are just...ugly. Actually, more so clunky instead.</p>
	<p>Some ESRs promote "ASCII-compatibility", which is to limit the scope of characters used to simply the ASCII table, aka the 26 letters of the alphabet. </p>
	<p>Unfortunately, with the amount of phonemes (and marginal phonemes) English has, it becomes very hard to represent all the sounds using only ASCII without having it look very ugly or clunky.</p>
	<p>An example of this is "actually", which recently gets the spelling "ackchyually" as a meme or joke (a reference to self-entitied obnoxious "nerds" dropping "fact bombs" on supposedly wrong information or opinions). Obviously we can understand the word, but some people will probably spell it "akk-choo-ull-lee" and make that the new spelling, which is just bad.</p>
	<p>The reason I emphasize on "this being bad if we use it as a spelling reform" is because this type of spelling actually gets used in dictionaries and webpages to help people read ambiguous or difficult words, much like how furigana works in Japanese to help people read kanji, and in that sense is very helpful.</p>
	<p>Back to the point, the alternative is to use diacritics, accent marks, or even borrow letters from other alphabets, which 1. already breaks the ASCII-only rule, and 2. there are many opponents of this approach.</p>
	<p>This boils down to the fact that English is (practically) the ONLY globally important language which rejects (or, to use a nicer term, does not use) accent marks. Out of the 6 working tongues of the UN, Chinese has tones; French, Russian and Spanish (and many other European languages which are not UN working languages) have their tildes and acutes; even Standard Arabic has a lot of dots to help distinguish sounds as an abjad (it used to NOT have that, or at least it isn't made official.)</p>
	<p>Some people even remove marks from loanwords, such as "facade" for "façade", and people are dropping diacritics for native English words as well, such as "naive" for "naïve" or "co-operate" for "coöperate", which goes on to show that for some people, English (and consequently ESRs) shouldn't even have diacritics.</p>
	<p>All in all, it is simply impossible to have a language look "pretty" without it being fully "ASCII-compatible", </p>
	<h3><b><u>4. The schwa and the strut</u></b></h3>
	<p>These 2 sounds (mostly schwa, aka the "a" at the end of "comma", or /ə/ if you want to use the IPA; the strut vowel is /ʌ/) are often the topic of many discussions in ESRs, and many proposals have been made on how to "solve this problem". Though it is useful to explain the origin of these 2 sounds first:</p>
	<p>The schwa comes from a reduced vowel (it can literally be anything), and many languages do have this feature of reducing their vowels (e.g. word-final "e" for German), though English does it on a much, <i>much</i> larger scale. A sidenote is that historically, many words ending with the letter "e" (especially the "magic e") became schwas and were then dropped, but the "e" was still written, and vowel changes led to the development of "long vowels" today.</p>
	<p>The strut comes from a change in the quality of historical /u/, mostly spelt "u"; but there are also examples of this sound being spelt "o" in words such as "love" and "son", which originates from the practice of not putting a "u" next to a "v" or "n" in medieval writing, as "u" and "v" were still the same letter and readers will have a hard time reading.In the present day, there also exists a "schwa-strut merger", whereby both vowels are pronounced the same.</p>
	<p>One of the methods proposed is to write every instance of schwa as a single letter (e.g: a, u, or even ə itself), while keeping the strut vowel spelt as "u". The cost of this is, of course, word relations; for example "grammar" (non-rhotic) and "grammatic", which would become *grammə and *grammatik, for example.</p>
	<p>Some people go a step further and just schwa and strut the same way (often also changing other letters) as they do sound similar, which doesn't work because schwa and strut have different origins, and lots of homoglyphs will be made (as if there weren't enough already, e.g. son and sun), which adds a further layer of confusion..</p>
	<h3><b><u>5. The Great Vowel Shift</u></b></h3>
	<p>I would rather call this the "Great Vowel Movement" because V and B are similar in phonetic value (and in other languages they often do shift to one another), and of course the GVS shitted all over the place regarding English vowels.</p>
	<p>There is often a temptation to "preserve" relations between historically "short" and "long" vowels, like how "dress" is short E, and "fleece" or "Pete" is long E.</p>
	<p>Personally, I do not object to this type of thinking. Many cases of the "long vowels" do come from vowels that historically sound the same as their short equivalents, just longer (like "meet" from above). Unfortunately, this is often not explained when English is taught to people, which is why it may seem so weird in the first place. (though, the average Joe probably wouldn't expect a history class in the middle of learning English; except maybe literature people, since it is useful to delve into historical English pronunciation to see why words rhyme when they don't in Modern English.)</p>
	<p>Some believe it is more useful to think of the "fleece" vowel as a longer version of the "kit" vowel (though, for many people, their quality isn't exactly the same either), and that is one way of thinking about it.</p>
	<p>I personally do have a system around this dilemma, which is featured in <a href="cookedenglish.html">Cooked English</a>. If you want to know more, please go read that.</p>

	<h2>just how many English spelling reforms were there?</h2>
	<p>The answer: a lot. As mentioned, with the Internet many reformers have sprung up and made their own reforms: some are good, some are bad.</p>
	<p>Here are <a href="catalogueofesrs.html">examples of ESRs I found from various sources</a>. Perhaps it is worth checking them out; both their motivation and their reception are useful.</p>
