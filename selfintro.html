	<br />
	<p>I am currently a year 3 medical student in Hong Kong.</p>
	<p>My interests: linguistics, history, mathematics, medicine, color theory, memes, music, photography, psychology, sightseeing, etc.
	<p>You can say that I am a "jack of all trades, master of none." </p>
	<p>Though I would argue that you have to master at least a few trades to live by; competition is tough, and money IS money.</p>

	<h2>what does "silikade" mean?</h2>
	<p>silikade is a portmanteau of "silicate" and "limeade", with the "c" replaced by a "k" for humorous effect.</p>
