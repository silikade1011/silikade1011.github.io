	<br />
	<p>I am (currently) a year 2 medical student in Hong Kong.</p>
	<p>My interests include: linguistics, history, mathematics, medicine, color theory, memes, music, photography, psychology, sightseeing, etc.
	<p>You can say that I am a "jack of all trades, master of none." </p>
	<p>Though I would argue that you'd have to master of at least a few trades for the sake of practicality and livelihood; if you aren't extra good at anything you might well get eliminated by competition. Money is money.</p>	
	<p>So yeah, this is me.</p>
	<br />
	<h2>what does "silikade" mean?</h2>
	<p>silikade is a portmanteau of "silicate" (as in, orthosilicate) and "limeade", with the "c" replaced by a "k" for extra effect lols.</p>
