	<h2>an introduction</h2>
	<p>English spelling, as we know it, sucks. There are way too much inconsistencies (even for words of an understandable etymology) and it simply cannot keep up with pronunciation, which changes way quicker than written forms. </p>
	<p>Therefore, some people have called for a reform of English spelling (I'll just call it ESRs), which has gained various levels of traction over history.</p>
	<p>With the Internet, it's now way easier to post a spelling reform on, say, Reddit, and let other people decide whether it is kek or cringe.</p>
	<br />
	<h2>a brief history of English spelling</h2>
	<p>English is generally classified as a West Germanic language, with tons of influence from Latin, various stages of French, Greek, etc.</p>
	<p>Though some may say that English should not be classified as Germanic, or that it even should be Romance, many commonly used words in our daily speech do descend from Old English, eg. "the", "I", "we".</p>
	<p>Additionally, it shares many innovations with other Germanic languages in areas such as grammar, and it is possible to construct sentences in those languages which match the format of English grammar, which cannot be done (or is difficult to do) in other languages.</p>
	<p>For example, we have this made by a wonderful Youtuber: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryVG5LHRMJ4">Universal Germanic Dialogue</a>, which demonstrates this.</p>
	<p>However, a large part of the exceptions and inconsistencies in English spelling comes from the fact that it has largely been fossilized ever since the introduction of dictionaries and the printing press, which caused it to remain stuck in the way words are spelt in Middle English.</p>
	<p>And, as various sound shifts (mainly the Great Vowel Shift) set in, spelling became outdated when compared to modern pronunciations.</p>
	<p>For example, the words "meat" and "meet" were pronounced differently a couple of centuries ago (/mɛt/ and /met/), but sound shifts have since made them sound the same (/miːt/, or /mɪjt/).</p>
	<p>Some further changes are also brought on by Medieval scribes wanting to relate English words back to its roots, with varying degrees of consistency and correctness.</p>
	<p>The word "debt" was originally spelt "det/dette", but the "b" was added to link it back to Latin "debitum".</p>
	<p>The word "island" got its silent "s" as it was believed that it came from Latin "insula", also in analogy with "isle" (but they were wrong; the spelling was kept though.)</p>
	<p>Some recent loanwords have even kept their original spelling, disregarding the regular "rules" of English pronunciation.</p>
	<p>For example, the "j" in joy, fjord, Jacque (a French name) and jalapeño all have different pronunciations: /dʒ/, /j/, /ʒ/, /x/ respectively.</p>
	<p>All of this are reasons for English spelling and words to be so wacky today.</p>
	<br />
	<h2>general arguments for reform</h2>
	<p><b>1. It saves learners time.</b></p>
	<p>This is one of the biggest proposed advantages of people who make English spelling reforms. Indeed, learners of English (as a second language other than their native tongue) often find aspects of English quirky. That's the forgiving way of saying it; at worst they find so many inconsistencies in English that it's just hard to keep up. Like why is "ea" different in great, lead (noun), and lead (verb)?</p>
	<p>Therefore, proponents of ESRs argue that simplifying English spelling or making it more consistent will help learners of English master the language, and help its spread as a global lingua franca.</p>
	<p>For example, people can guess the pronunciation of an unfamiliar word more easily without going through tons of guesswork and exceptions.</p>
	<p><b>2. It saves costs.</b></p>
	<p>Now, this isn't that much of a concern since we have the Internet and various hosting websites, but back in the day printing of books was basically the only method by which learners can get a grasp of what English is like. And English contains many digraphs and letters that supporters deem "redundant", such as silent letters.</p>
	<p>Supporters of ESRs have hence put forward the argument that ESRs can help save printing costs by shortening word length, which accumulates when you consider an entire bloc of text.</p>
	<p>For example, "the" may be spelt like "þe" (this is the letter "thorn"), which is around a 33% decrease in length.</p>
	<p><b></b></p>
	<br />
	<h2>general arguments against reform</h2>
	<p><b>1. Dialects</b></p>
	<p>This is one of the most vocal arguments against English spelling reforms. Unlike, say, French or German, there is no one unitary organization or advisory body that governs English spelling and make updates to it, even in present time.</p>
	<p>Additionally, with the British Empire colonizing every rock in existence, English is now the de facto lingua franca of the world, and many speakers - both native and learners - have developed their own dialects.</p>
	<p>This is also called an "idiolect", which is the way that a certain person speaks. Of course, idiolects can be different from person to person, even among the same country or region.</p>
	<p>For example, some people may pronounce the "a" in "bath" as /ɑ/, while others may read it as /æ/; and some people may coalesce yods (y's) or glottalize their t's, which is why stuff like "Chewsday" or "bo'ol o' wo'er" exist.</p>
	<p>How do we accommodate the many different readings?</p>
	<p><b>2. For etymology sake</b></p>
	<p>Other than dialects, ESRs are also likely to get shot down by this reason: etymology.</p>
	<p>Unlike, for example, Standard German or Icelandic, English has brought in a lot of words outside their own Germanic roots from Old English, which over time got their spellings nativized.</p>
	<p>It is thus argued that keeping spelling this way reflects its origin, which helps learners understand where it came from.</p>
	<p>As an example, even though every "c" in Pacific Ocean is spelt differently, "Pacific" comes from a Latin word, while "Ocean" got its pronunciation from Old/Middle French.</p>
	<p>Additionally, ESRs may sometimes cause word links to be lost, which hinders learners from understanding word relations.</p>
	<p>Like the "g" in "sign", which is silent; but is read in "signature" (notice how the "i" is also read differently in the 2 words.)</p>
	<p>It is thus argued that keeping spelling unchanged reflects its origin, which helps learners understand where it came from.</p>
